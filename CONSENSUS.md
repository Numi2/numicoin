# NumiCoin Consensus Mechanism

## Overview

NumiCoin uses a **pure Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model** with Argon2id for block creation and security.

## üî® Primary Consensus: Proof-of-Work (PoW)

### How Block Creation Works

1. **Mining Process**:
   - Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles using **Argon2id**
   - Each block contains a **nonce** that miners increment to find a valid solution
   - The puzzle difficulty adjusts every 30 blocks to maintain ~15 second block times

2. **Block Validation**:
   - Network validates the Argon2id proof-of-work solution
   - All transactions in the block are verified with **Dilithium3 signatures**
   - Block structure and hash are validated

3. **Mining Rewards**:
   - Successful miners receive NUMI tokens as rewards
   - Rewards decrease over time (halving every 100,000 blocks)
   - Transaction fees are also collected by miners

### Argon2id Proof-of-Work

```rust
// From miner.rs - The actual mining process
pub fn mine_block(
    &mut self,
    height: u64,
    previous_hash: BlockHash,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    difficulty: u32,
    start_nonce: u64,
) -> Result<Option<MiningResult>>
```

**Parameters**:
- **Memory Cost**: 4096 KiB (8192 KiB for dedicated mining nodes)
- **Time Cost**: 3 iterations (4 for dedicated nodes)
- **Parallelism**: 1 thread (2 for dedicated nodes)
- **Output Length**: 32 bytes
- **Salt Length**: 16 bytes

**Security Benefits**:
- **ASIC Resistant**: Memory-hard algorithm prevents specialized hardware
- **GPU Resistant**: High memory requirements limit GPU efficiency
- **CPU Optimized**: Designed for general-purpose CPUs



## üîÑ Consensus Flow

### Block Creation Flow
```
1. Miner creates block with pending transactions
2. Miner solves Argon2id puzzle (PoW)
3. Block is broadcast to network
4. Network validates PoW solution
5. Network validates all transactions (Dilithium3 signatures)
6. Block is added to blockchain
7. Miner receives NUMI reward
```



## üîê Security Model

### Multi-Layer Security

1. **Cryptographic Security**:
   - **Dilithium3**: Post-quantum signatures for all transactions
   - **Argon2id**: Memory-hard proof-of-work for block creation
   - **Blake3**: Fast hashing for block and transaction IDs
   - **Kyber**: Post-quantum key exchange for peer communication

2. **Economic Security**:
   - **Mining Rewards**: Incentivizes honest mining
   - **Transaction Fees**: Prevents spam and DoS attacks

3. **Network Security**:
   - **Peer Authentication**: All peers authenticated with Dilithium3
   - **Rate Limiting**: Protection against spam and DoS
   - **IP Blocking**: Automatic blocking of malicious peers
