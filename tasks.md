# NumiCoin Production Readiness Tasks

Here is a list of tasks to get the NumiCoin project ready for production.

### 1. Resolve Architectural Contradiction
The project currently contains two separate technology stacks: a custom blockchain in Rust (`core`) and an Ethereum-based wallet/token system (`numi-wallet`). You must decide which architecture to proceed with, as they are currently incompatible.

### 2. Core Backend (Rust) Tasks
*   **Conduct Security Audit:** Perform a full security audit on the Rust codebase, focusing on consensus rules, cryptography, and network attack vectors to ensure network integrity.
*   **Implement Comprehensive Testing:** Write extensive unit and integration tests covering all critical logic, including transaction processing, block validation, and P2P communication, to guarantee stability.
*   **Harden P2P Network Layer:** Improve the peer-to-peer networking layer's robustness and security to defend against common threats like DDoS or eclipse attacks.
*   **Formalize Governance Model:** Define and implement a clear on-chain or off-chain governance process for handling future protocol upgrades and parameter changes.

### 3. Numi-Wallet (Next.js) Tasks
*   **Integrate with Chosen Backend:** If the Rust core is chosen, replace all Ethereum-specific logic (`ethers.js`, etc.) with a new client to communicate with the Rust node's RPC API.
*   **Perform Frontend Security Audit:** Audit the wallet's key generation, storage, and transaction signing processes to protect users from client-side vulnerabilities and fund loss.
*   **Finalize UI/UX:** Complete all UI components and user flows, ensuring the application is intuitive, accessible, and provides clear feedback on all operations.
*   **Add Progressive Web App (PWA) Features:** Fully implement service workers and caching strategies to make the wallet installable and functional offline for a better mobile experience.

### 4. Smart Contracts (Solidity) Tasks
*   **Audit Smart Contracts:** If pursuing the Ethereum path, the `NumiCoin.sol` and `MiningPool.sol` contracts must undergo a professional security audit to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Analyze and optimize the Solidity contracts to reduce gas costs for deployment and user interactions on the Ethereum mainnet.

### 5. General & Deployment Tasks
*   **Establish Production Infrastructure:** Define and set up a reliable infrastructure for seed nodes, explorers, and monitoring tools to ensure network health and visibility.
*   **Create Public Documentation:** Write clear, comprehensive documentation for end-users, node operators, and developers who may want to build on NumiCoin.
