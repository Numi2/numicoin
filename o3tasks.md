# Production Readiness Tasks

1. **Increase Test Coverage** – Add comprehensive unit and integration tests across all Rust core modules (block, blockchain, mempool, network) to reach >90% coverage.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** – Set up automated pipelines that run `cargo fmt/clippy/test` and `npm run lint/test` on every push, then build & publish versioned artifacts.
3. **Secure Networking** – Encrypt peer connections (TLS/Noise) and implement rate-limiting & peer reputation to mitigate DDoS and Sybil attacks.
4. **Security Audit** – Commission an external audit of cryptography, consensus logic, and Solidity contracts and remediate all findings.
5. **Observability** – Add structured logging and Prometheus metrics to core and wallet so blocks, mempool size, and errors are actively monitored.
6. **Performance Tuning** – Profile block validation & mining loops, parallelize hot paths, and benchmark to sustain mainnet-scale throughput.
7. **Resilient Storage** – Implement migration tooling and crash-safe replay so nodes recover gracefully after unexpected shutdowns.
8. **RPC Hardening** – Finalize RPC spec, generate OpenAPI docs, and add authentication (JWT/token) for wallet and third-party apps.
9. **Public Testnet Launch** – Deploy contracts and nodes to a public testnet and run long-haul soak tests under realistic traffic.
10. **Real-time Wallet Sync** – Implement live balance & tx history updates via WebSocket/polling in the Next.js wallet UI.
11. **Smart-Contract Integration** – Wire wallet flows for staking, governance votes, and mining-pool rewards using deployed contracts.
12. **UX & Accessibility** – Add robust client-side error handling, form validation, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation support.
13. **Full PWA Support** – Finish offline caching, push notifications, and install banners; test across iOS, Android, and desktop browsers.
14. **Frontend Optimization** – Reduce bundle size with code-splitting, enable ISR, and use Next.js image optimization for faster loads.
15. **End-to-End Testing** – Write Cypress/Playwright tests covering onboarding, send/receive, staking, and governance user journeys.
16. **Containerization & Orchestration** – Provide Dockerfiles and docker-compose/K8s manifests to run core nodes and wallet at scale.
17. **Secrets & Certificates** – Integrate Vault/K8s secrets and automated TLS certificate provisioning (e.g., Let’s Encrypt) for all services.
18. **Centralized Logging & Alerts** – Ship logs to ELK/Grafana and configure alert rules for blocktime drift, mempool overflow, and critical errors.
19. **Documentation Site** – Publish setup guides, API reference, troubleshooting steps, and security best practices for operators & users.
20. **Release Management** – Tag v1.0, sign binaries, publish checksums, and adopt semantic versioning for future releases.
