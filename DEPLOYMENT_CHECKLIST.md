## üéØ Quick Start Options

### Option A: GitHub Releases (Easiest)
**Time to Deploy: 1-2 hours**

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Push your code to GitHub
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/numicoin.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Create Release Tag**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Automatic Build & Release**
   - GitHub Actions will automatically build for all platforms
   - Creates release with download links
   - Users download from: `https://github.com/your-username/numicoin/releases`

**‚úÖ Best for:** Quick launch, minimal infrastructure

### Option B: Custom Website (Professional)
**Time to Deploy: 4-8 hours**

1. **Setup Hosting**
   - Get domain name
   - Set up VPS or hosting service
   - Configure SSL certificate

2. **Deploy Website**
   ```bash
   # Upload website/ folder to your server
   scp -r website/* user@your-server.com:/var/www/html/
   ```

3. **Upload Binaries**
   ```bash
   # Build and upload executables
   ./build-release.sh
   scp releases/* user@your-server.com:/var/www/html/downloads/
   ```

**‚úÖ Best for:** Professional appearance, custom branding

### Option C: Full P2P Network (Advanced)
**Time to Deploy: 1-2 days**

1. **Set Up Seed Nodes**
   ```bash
   # On your VPS
   ./numi-core start --listen-addr 0.0.0.0:8333 --enable-mining false
   ```

2. **Update Bootstrap Nodes**
   - Edit `one_click_miner_networked.rs`
   - Add your seed node IPs
   - Rebuild with new bootstrap nodes

3. **Launch Network**
   - Deploy seed nodes first
   - Release networked miners
   - Monitor network health

**‚úÖ Best for:** True decentralization, global network
