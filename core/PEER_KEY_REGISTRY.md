# Peer Key Registry System

## Overview

The Peer Key Registry system addresses a critical security vulnerability in the original implementation where peer public keys were assumed to be known at handshake time. This system provides a secure mechanism for discovering, storing, and validating peer identities in the Numi blockchain network.

## Security Problem Solved

### Original Issue
The previous implementation assumed that peer Dilithium3 and Kyber public keys were already known when establishing connections, which is unrealistic in a real P2P network. This created several security vulnerabilities:

1. **No peer authentication**: New peers couldn't be authenticated
2. **Key replacement attacks**: Malicious actors could impersonate peers
3. **No bootstrap mechanism**: No way to establish initial trust

### Solution
The Peer Key Registry provides:
1. **Dynamic key discovery**: Peers can request and exchange public keys
2. **Key verification**: Cryptographic verification of peer identities
3. **Bootstrap node support**: Trusted nodes with pre-configured keys
4. **Replay protection**: Timestamp and nonce-based message validation

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. PeerKeyRegistry
```rust
pub struct PeerKeyRegistry {
    dilithium_keys: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<PeerId, Vec<u8>>>>,
    kyber_keys: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<PeerId, Vec<u8>>>>,
    pending_requests: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<PeerId, Instant>>>,
    bootstrap_keys: HashMap<PeerId, (Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>)>,
    verified_keys: Arc<RwLock<HashSet<PeerId>>>,
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Store peer public keys (Dilithium3 and Kyber)
- Track pending key requests
- Manage bootstrap node keys
- Track verification status

#### 2. Key Exchange Protocol
The system implements a request-response protocol for key exchange:

**KeyRequest Message:**
```rust
KeyRequest {
    requester_id: String,
    timestamp: u64,
    nonce: u64,
    signature: Vec<u8>,
}
```

**KeyResponse Message:**
```rust
KeyResponse {
    responder_id: String,
    dilithium_pk: Vec<u8>,
    kyber_pk: Vec<u8>,
    timestamp: u64,
    nonce: u64,
    signature: Vec<u8>,
}
```

#### 3. Integration with NetworkManager
The NetworkManager now includes:
- Automatic key discovery on peer connection
- Key registry integration
- Secure handshake using discovered keys

## Workflow

### 1. Peer Connection
```
Peer A connects to Peer B
    ↓
Check if B's keys are known
    ↓
If not known: Send KeyRequest
    ↓
Peer B responds with KeyResponse
    ↓
Store and verify keys
    ↓
Mark peer as verified
```

### 2. Bootstrap Node Handling
```
Connect to bootstrap node
    ↓
Check if it's a known bootstrap node
    ↓
If yes: Use pre-configured keys
    ↓
Mark as verified immediately
```

### 3. Key Verification Process
```
Receive KeyResponse
    ↓
Extract responder's public key
    ↓
Verify signature on response
    ↓
Store keys in registry
    ↓
Mark peer as verified
```

## Security Features

### 1. Cryptographic Verification
- All key exchange messages are signed with Dilithium3
- Signatures include timestamp and nonce for replay protection
- Public keys are verified before storage

### 2. Replay Protection
- Each message includes a timestamp and nonce
- Timestamps must be within ±5 minutes of current time
- Nonces must be strictly increasing for each peer

### 3. Bootstrap Node Trust
- Bootstrap nodes have pre-configured public keys
- Keys are loaded from trusted sources
- No key exchange needed for bootstrap nodes

### 4. Key Expiration
- Pending requests expire after 30 seconds
- Failed key exchanges are retried automatically
- Disconnected peers have keys removed

## Configuration

### Bootstrap Node Setup
```rust
// In PeerKeyRegistry::initialize_bootstrap_keys()
let bootstrap_peer_id = PeerId::from_bytes(&[/* actual peer ID bytes */]).unwrap();
let bootstrap_dilithium_pk = vec![/* actual Dilithium3 public key */];
let bootstrap_kyber_pk = vec![/* actual Kyber public key */];
self.bootstrap_keys.insert(bootstrap_peer_id, (bootstrap_dilithium_pk, bootstrap_kyber_pk));
```

### Production Deployment
For production deployment, bootstrap node keys should be:
1. **Hardcoded** in the binary for maximum security
2. **Distributed** through secure channels
3. **Regularly rotated** to maintain security
4. **Monitored** for any suspicious activity

## API Reference

### PeerKeyRegistry Methods

#### Key Management
```rust
// Store peer keys
async fn store_peer_keys(&self, peer_id: PeerId, dilithium_pk: Vec<u8>, kyber_pk: Vec<u8>)

// Retrieve keys
async fn get_dilithium_key(&self, peer_id: &PeerId) -> Option<Vec<u8>>
async fn get_kyber_key(&self, peer_id: &PeerId) -> Option<Vec<u8>>

// Check key availability
async fn has_complete_keys(&self, peer_id: &PeerId) -> bool
```

#### Verification
```rust
// Check verification status
async fn is_verified(&self, peer_id: &PeerId) -> bool

// Mark as verified
async fn mark_verified(&self, peer_id: PeerId)
```

#### Key Discovery
```rust
// Request keys if needed
async fn request_keys_if_needed(&self, peer_id: PeerId) -> bool

// Get verified peers
async fn get_verified_peers(&self) -> Vec<PeerId>
```

#### Maintenance
```rust
// Clean up expired requests
async fn cleanup_expired_requests(&self)

// Remove peer keys
async fn remove_peer_keys(&self, peer_id: &PeerId)
```

## NetworkManager Integration

### Automatic Key Discovery
```rust
async fn on_peer_connected(&self, peer_id: PeerId) {
    // Request keys if we don't have them
    if self.key_registry.request_keys_if_needed(peer_id).await {
        self.send_key_request(peer_id).await;
    }
}
```

### Key Exchange Handling
```rust
async fn handle_key_exchange_message(&mut self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<()> {
    // Handle KeyRequest and KeyResponse messages
    // Verify signatures and store keys
}
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
- **Mitigation**: All key exchange messages are cryptographically signed
- **Verification**: Signatures are verified before key storage
- **Trust**: Bootstrap nodes provide initial trust anchors

### 2. Replay Attacks
- **Mitigation**: Timestamp and nonce-based replay protection
- **Window**: 5-minute timestamp skew tolerance
- **Uniqueness**: Strictly increasing nonces per peer

### 3. Key Replacement Attacks
- **Detection**: Signature verification prevents key spoofing
- **Prevention**: Bootstrap nodes provide trusted key sources
- **Monitoring**: Logging of all key exchange activities

### 4. Denial of Service
- **Rate Limiting**: Pending request expiration (30 seconds)
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired requests
- **Connection Limits**: Maximum pending requests per peer

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Distributed Hash Table (DHT)
- Replace floodsub with Kademlia DHT for key discovery
- Improve scalability for large networks
- Reduce network overhead

### 2. Certificate Authority
- Implement a CA system for peer identity verification
- Support for certificate chains
- Revocation mechanisms

### 3. Key Rotation
- Automatic key rotation for long-lived peers
- Forward secrecy improvements
- Key update protocols

### 4. Reputation System
- Track peer behavior and key exchange success rates
- Penalize malicious peers
- Reward reliable peers

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```rust
#[test]
async fn test_key_registry_operations() {
    let registry = PeerKeyRegistry::new();
    let peer_id = PeerId::random();
    
    // Test key storage and retrieval
    registry.store_peer_keys(peer_id, vec![1,2,3], vec![4,5,6]).await;
    assert!(registry.has_complete_keys(&peer_id).await);
    
    // Test verification
    registry.mark_verified(peer_id).await;
    assert!(registry.is_verified(&peer_id).await);
}
```

### Integration Tests
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_key_exchange_protocol() {

## Conclusion

The Peer Key Registry system provides a robust foundation for secure peer-to-peer communication in the Numi blockchain. By implementing dynamic key discovery, cryptographic verification, and replay protection, it addresses the critical security vulnerabilities identified in the original implementation.

This system ensures that:
1. **All peers can be authenticated** through cryptographic verification
